## Abstract
Sessions is a therapeutic tool that combines alternative forms of therapy with the serenity of the ocean. Although research has proven that our perceptions are governed by the mind and can be altered as a result of certain anxiety disorders, it has also proven that the mind desires clarity and can adapt to other natural rhythms if stimulated. Water has been linked to providing mental clarity throughout history – from ancient Greek bathhouses, to modern day beach vacations. Sessions uses the sensations of the ocean to calm and relax users. Through creating a mobile tool to combine proven forms of therapy, comprehensive biometric data, and a meditational retreat for over stimulation, Sessions is the pocket therapist for anxiety.

## 1 INTRODUCTION
> *“I surf to both find myself and get away from myself. Surfing centers me. It lets me forget about the negative and focus in the positives in my life. It brings me back to reality.” –Andy Irons, I Surf Because (2010) *

Marketers love to say, "Perception IS reality". Our “reality” is made up of our thoughts, emotional memories, and perceptions. Research has proven that our realities can be altered as a result of certain anxiety disorders. Sessions is a therapeutic tool that combines different forms of therapy intended for people with anxiety. Originating from a personal method of coping with anxiety, a visualization of the ocean is used as a representation of the users anxiety level. The ocean’s rhythmic movement and therapeutic tones are used as meditational tools to calm the user.  In mobile form, it provides the user with treatment when and where it is needed without an appointment with a mental health professional. As a clinical tool, this provides the most comprehensive treatment and view of progress. Through creating this mobile tool to combine proven forms of therapy with the serenity of the ocean, Sessions will also create an opportunity for meditational escape from overstimulation, which triggers anxiety.

###1.1 Motivations.
Everyone experiences anxiety in some form or another, like when taking a test, or presenting to a room full of people, some people experience anxiety in a different way. My father has Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, a type of anxiety disorder that is defined by obsessive fear or worry caused by intrusive thoughts. While this adheres him to a strict daily routine, it often makes him unable to make simple decisions. The consequences of change cause his anxiety to trigger seizures.

Similar to my father, I also have an anxiety disorder. When my own anxiety began to grow uncontrollable, hindering me from going to work, I began to search for treatment. With cognitive-behavioral therapy, I was encouraged to keep a journal of my experiences each time I had an attack. Holistic remedies were used, such as Tai Chi, to physically practice asserting control over my body functions with a set of routines. With each attack I became more aware of my own body rhythms, both in a “relaxed” and in a “panic” state. While this was helpful in recognizing triggers and heightened anxiety, it was still hard for me to put anxiety-producing thoughts into perspective without the help of a therapist. When I began surfing, something changed, I was able to keep uncontrollable anxious feelings manageable and my thoughts had perspective. Surfing became a ritual, paddling out, battling the white water, finding a rhythm to get to the break and eventually feeling a release when catching wave into shore.

Unfortunately, while surfing, for me, has been the most successful treatment for my own anxiety, I cannot always drop everything to go when that anxious feeling sets in. In an attempt to manage these feelings of anxiety at work, I began carrying a bar of surf wax in my pocket. When I felt anxious, the smell and feeling of the wax prompt similar feelings to actually surfing. By creating Sessions, I am passing the “bar of wax” to others in need.

###1.2 Concept.
This application requires the user to wear an activity/biometric tracker to acquire anxiety levels throughout the day. As the user’s anxiety level begins to rise to a designated threshold, the user is notified to take a deep breath, allowing for him/her to be aware of their increasing level before it becomes a full-fledged attack. When the user is calmer, they will see a calmer display of waves, and as anxiety grows the waves get choppier. While the thought of someone seeing rougher waves seems like it may be more anxiety provoking, the use of light sounds of softer rain and water a calming constant.

When used with a mental health provider, equipment such as EEG’s are used in addition to the accumulated data from every day use, to offer a more in depth and comprehensive treatment. Together, as a mobile clinical and mobile application, Sessions offers the user a comprehensive view of their own progress by wearing popular non-intrusive tracking devices without changing their daily routines. Currently, Sessions is being tested with a small group of individuals who have anxiety disorders ranging from PTSD to generalized anxiety.


## 2 DOMAINS & PRECEDENTS

###2.1 Anxiety Disorders & Brain Functions.
Anxiety disorders are some of the most commonly known mental disorders in Americans: obsessive-compulsive, panic, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized and social anxiety. (National Institute of Mental Health) Many scientists today believe that mental illnesses, such as these anxiety disorders, are the result of a combination of factors including genetic, environmental, psychological and developmental factors.

The duration and symptoms vary with each disorder. Some, like panic attacks, are short with intense symptoms. (Ankrom) According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-IV-TR, the symptoms that one can experience when having anxiety can include at least four of the following: palpitations, pounding or racing heartbeat, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, the feeling of being smothered or choking, chest pain or discomfort, nausea or abdominal distress, lightheadedness, sensation of being dizzy or fainting, feelings of de-realization or depersonalization, fears of becoming insane or dying, numbness or tingling sensations and chills or hot flashes. By instilling the symptom of fear or dying when there is no ‘real’ fear or ‘risk’ of death, these disorders distort the realities for people who have them. This supports the concept that one’s brain can manifest realities without the conscious control of the individual.

The most common symptom within anxiety disorders is the feeling of fear. Normally fear is the brain’s response to an external stimulus; however, with anxiety disorders this can be experienced without an external stimulus.

The brain is genetically different for each person, causing some individuals to have a higher level of fear than others. In the average human body the largest portion of the brain is the Cerebral Cortex.  It contains anywhere from 15-33 billion neurons (Pelvig, Pakkenberg and Stark), which are connected by approximately 100 trillion synapses. (Williams and Herrup) Neurons communicate to one another using protoplasmic fibers, called dendrites and axons. They relay the signals for the brain to assert control over the body and all of its organs and functions.  The synapses have a variety of functions ranging from changing the chemistry of a cell to changing the stretching of signals that pass through them. (Sheperd, The Synaptic Organization of the Brain) The processing ability of our brain rests on this local communication. (Schnitzler, Alfons and Gross) The two parts of the brain that play a large part in the development of the feelings of fear and anxiety are amygdala and hippocampus. (National Institute of Mental Health)

The amygdala is almond-shaped and located deep within the medial temporal portion of the brain. The role of this portion of the brain is to act as a communications hub for deciphering and processing memories and emotional reactions. (Amunts, Kredo and Kindler) When a stimulus triggers a signal to the brain, this information is then processed through the lateral amygdala to the central nucleus.  (LeDoux ) The nucleus of the amygdala begins to send the rest of the brain signals to regulate the responses to the stimulus. (LeDoux ) When there are emotional memories present in the amygdala they are usually triggers for phobias. (LeDoux ) As a response to fear, this portion of the brain sends messages to the hypothalamus, which activates the fight or flight response as well as the release of stress hormones and glucocorticoids. (LeDoux )

The hippocampus is the sea horse shaped portion of the brain also located in the medial temporal lobe. Like the amygdala, the hippocampus regulates memories, but does not send out an emotional response. (Buzsaki ) This section encodes short-term memories into long term. These memories create anxiety when memories include trauma, causing post-traumatic stress disorder. (Buzsaki ) In some cases, people with anxiety disorders have been known to have a smaller hippocampus than others due to atrophy of the dendrites of the neurons that make up this portion of the brain. (Vyas, Chattarji and Jadhav) This damage to the dendrites is caused by the release of the glucocorticoids and limits the individual’s ability to use memories for the evaluation of stressors. (Vyas, Chattarji and Jadhav) This is why people with anxiety disorders may experience the feeling of fear without having any external stimulus.

###2.2 Earliest Records of Anxiety Disorders & Treatments.
With an understanding how anxiety can affect one’s ‘reality’, we can now further explore the concept of altering one’s behavior as a remedy to this altered view of reality.

The earliest documentation of treatments for anxiety disorders and their treatment were documented in Egyptian medical papers, also known as Ebers Papyrus. (Nasser) These papers recorded hysteria with symptoms such as a sense of suffocation, the feeling of pending doom or death, and seizures. (Nasser) Egyptians believed this was disease that only affected women, caused was a wondering uterus “blocking passages, obstructing breathing and causing diseases” (Sigerist). Patients were treated with herbal mixes were placed by her head to be inhaled and similar mixes placed by her vagina to rectify the positioning of the uterus (Cosmacini) to cause to facilitate sleep and encouraged to spend time with cruises down the Nile. Ritual healings included reciting spells or mantras in the safety of a religious temple. (Nasser)

Hysteria, in Greek Mythology, was once again only effected women. Greeks believed that the uterus would wander about the body. Plato states in the Timaeus hat the uterus is similar to a creature and travels throughout a woman’s body “blocking passages, obstructing breathing, and causing disease.” (King) Other Greek philosophers, including Aristotle and Hippocrates, also believed the abnormal movements of the uterus. This movement was caused by the corruption of a woman’s physiological fluids due the lack of a normal sex life. (Sigerist) Women at this time were advised to engage in sexual activity, or once again use herbal remedies to the face and genitals to encourage the uterus to return to a normal position. (Sigerist) Later on, Soranus - a physician practicing in the first century, claimed that the labor of reproduction caused these disorders. He recommended hot bathes, massages, and exercise to woman who suffered from hysteria. (Sigerist)

Greek philosophies spread throughout Europe in The Middle Ages. During this time a woman from Salerno, Trotula de Ruggiero was a physician who became an expert in women’s diseases and disorders. She followed Hippocrates beliefs that abstinence was seen as the cause of illnesses. In her work she focused on giving advice to placate sexual pleasure in addition to recommending herbal remedies, including oils and mint, to sedate the woman. (Green) As the Crusades and religion started to play a larger role, a woman with these disorders became seen as “evil minded”, or witches with “demonical vision”. (Aquinas)

For many years following, hysteria was still seen as a woman’s ailment caused by possession by evil or witchcraft. During the early Renaissance and later Middle Ages, many cultures believed people with these disorders were possessed. Djins and priests, holy men for Islamic and Christian cultures, treated these people with ritualistic practices of removing the harmful spirit from the possessed body. (BBC News) Other countries treated people who were vocal about symptoms with torture (Spain), execution (Britain) or burning at the stake (Scottand).

The Civil War brought about some of the first recognized cases of males with an anxiety disorder, although they were never considered anxiety disorders; Instead soldiers who experienced chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, and fatigue were thought to have irritable heart syndrome. (Instituto de Medicina Social, Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brasil.)This is now known as DaCosta Syndrome, an anxiety disorder similar to Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder. Although the understanding of anxiety disorders had grown more authentic, the treatment at this time, including opium, and ethyl alcohol and bromide salts, only offered a temporary solution.

In the Victorian era, the “hysterical” were seen as being crazy. Many people exhibiting symptoms of anxiety at this time were sent to an asylum. At the asylum they would be treated with electroshock therapy, using electrical currents to shock the brain into a healthier state, and potentially lobotomy, removing the effected part of the brain. Similar to ancient Greek treatments, the at home therapy invented at this time was a vibrator. (Castleman M.A.)

Freud’s theory of male hysteria was a turning point in treatments. Freud associated hysteria to a psychoanalytical theory discussing how childhood fantasies can influence how one develops. (Pérez-Rincón) During his studies of male hysteria with Joseph Breuer, Freud expresses that male hysteria is caused by the lack of attachment developed, or libidinal settling, resulting not in a disease but an inability to live a mature relationship. (Pérez-Rincón, Pierre Janet, Sigmund Freud and Charcot's psychological and psychiatric legacy)Female hysteria was still considered an illness linked to the evolved concept of possession.

During the early 20th century, anxiety disorders began to be seen as medical conditions. Shell and Battle Shock were terms/conditions recognized by the Russian army during World War I. These conditions were often treated with barbiturates at this time to sedate the patient. Later on muscle relaxation techniques and electroshock therapies were used. (Goodpaster) As the number of patients with this disorder grew, people began to advocate for better conditions. Freud’s influence on treatments brought about psychoanalysis, and after World War II, the first version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) was created.

It wasn’t until after the 1950’s that many modern day treatments came into existence. Although people have been experiencing anxiety through out history, only recently in 1980 was it recognized as a treatable mental disorder.


###2.3 Eastern Influences.
Ancient Chinese cultures took a much different approach, seeing healing in the connections between mind and body they treated these disorders with more natural forms of remedy. Many of these tools have been proven a successful approach and are still used today by alternative practices.

In Eastern Cultures meditation was key to keeping the body in balance. The earliest treatment for anxiety in Chinese history is acupuncture. (Ernst) Chinese believed that an energy force called, qi, regulates the bodies over all health. When a person was ill, or in this case anxious, the qi was not able to flow freely. By placing needles in certain areas, they allowed the qi to run freely throughout the body, alleviating any symptoms. In addition to acupuncture, treatments also included herbal mixes to calm and restore balance to the body.

Qi Gong, a meditative exercise, combines medical, spiritual and martial aspects of Chinese cultures to maintain health, heal ailments, calm the mind, and reconnect with the spirit. Medical aspects required one to use posture to enhance the effects of breathing techniques. When activities are done together one can achieve mental clarity. These exercises, similarly to acupuncture increase the qi energies and the others circulate it, rehabilitating the body. Movements are added to stances rhythmically to facilitate the reduction of stress, increase energy levels and build up the immune system. Similar to yoga and Pilates, Qi Gong has a positive effect on physiological systems, including but not limited to the circulatory, digestive, cardiac, respiratory and nervous systems.  Qi Gong has many styles; two more popular styles still used today include Tai Chi, as soft, ad Kung Fu, as more intense.

During the Ming dynasty, Chinese people began to use iron balls as tools to enhance their meditation. Each ball was approximately two inches in diameter. The exercise of using these balls as tools required the user to rotate two of these balls in the palm of one hand. The rotation should be even and a consistent distance should be kept between the balls. As a portable object these balls offered a tool for meditation that could be used anywhere, as the user needed them. This was one of the first mobile objects used to facilitate the management of anxiety. These meditation balls, currently known as Baoding Balls, are still used today for meditational purposes.

###### *Fig. 6 Image of Baoding Balls and diagram of hand acupuncture points provided by http://www.alquimiainterna.com/*

Virtue, meditation and wisdom are seen as necessities in order to follow the path to enlightenment. Mantras, or words spoken to aide meditation, were believed to have sacred powers. In their earliest uses they were used to repel malign influences, but then evolved into guard spiritual life. Finally they once again evolved into salvation. Tibetan monks used these mantras as scriptures and tales of virtue. As a result from meditation, the mind is calmed - able to overcome obstacles and develops a deeper understanding – increasing wisdom. (Bodhi) These techniques have been in growing demand by modern psychologists and psychiatrists to aid in numerous health conditions including depression and anxiety. (Brach)

###2.4 Modern Day Treatments.
Today, anxiety disorders are treated with a number of different therapies. These therapies include, but are not limited to, metabolic, cognitive behavioral, physical, music, water and play. In each therapeutic experience, subjects rely on the awareness of self to progress in treatment.

**Cognitive Behavioral.** Perception is critical to one’s emotional responses. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy addresses these perceptions and how they contribute to anxiety as well as how one reacts to situations that provoke anxiety.  By using a method called cognitive restructuring (Anxiety & Depression Association of America), one challenges their negative thinking patterns. This is initially implemented with journaling to pinpoint triggers that cause anxiety. A mental health provider then helps the patient break down their triggers in a series of exercises such as, pro and con lists. Once the patient has identified the thought or fear as irrational the mental health provider can facilitate the realization of a realistic healthier thought. (Help Guide) During therapy sessions the patient will also learn to recognize physical symptoms prior to the onset of an attack, as well as coping skills and relaxation techniques to counteract an attack. (Help Guide)

**Physiological Rhythms.** Our physiological rhythms are central to life and consist of changes in the body marking its functions. The most common examples of these cycles are heartbeats, muscle movements, sleep, and menstruation. (Glass, Synchronization and rhythmic processes in physiology) These rhythms fluctuate irregularly over time. (Glass, Synchronization and rhythmic processes in physiology) A perfect example of these fluctuations in rhythms is the heartbeat. When the heart is functioning normally, there is a visible, yet predictable change in the rhythm each time it contracts. If the environment changes and more stressors are added, the release of stress hormones (i.e., adrenaline) elevates the heart rate, and the demand for blood grows. This causes the heart to work harder and pump faster, increasing the heart rate rhythm. Another example uses the brain’s alpha wave. When one is awake and active the alpha wave there is a visible, weakness in the amplitude of the wave. As one closes their eyes, and relaxes, the wave amplitude adjusts and peaks at a higher amplitude and frequency. While this example displays how changes in the biologic rhythms can be beneficial, they can also represent a negative change in the state of mind.

Depending on the strength of these rhythms, some rhythms have been known to synchronize with other people’s rhythms surrounding them. Synchronization in physiological cycles has become a new way of treating patients with mental disorders and brain diseases including, but not limited to, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, cerebral palsy, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, traumatic brain injuries and strokes. (Thaut)

###### *Fig. 8 Diagram showing differences in brainwaves provided by http://artefuturo.blogspot.com/*

**Brainwave Entrainment.** The modifications of rhythms is the basis for Brainwave entrainment. This application of physiological rhythm modification is where users are subject to a tone to see if the brain would modify itself to synchronize with, thus changing the user’s state of mind. Arturo Manns – producing muscle relaxation, G. Solomon and D Anderson – revolving around migraines, did some of these studies and most recently, Joyce, Siever & Twittey improving attention and reaction time in the treatment of behavior disorders. (Donaldson-Evans)

**Biofeedback Therapy.** Biometric data is most frequently used to help one gain control over involuntary functions such as chronic pain, urinary incontinence, high blood pressure, tension headaches and migraines. (University of Maryland Medical Center) During a biofeedback session electrodes are attached to a person’s skin and a monitor displays the physiological data. For someone experiencing anxiety in response to stimuli, this data could display disturbances in normal heart and breath rhythms, increased temperature (National Institute of Mental Health) and a decrease of metabolic activity in the frontal lobe (showing activity in the emotional/memory processing centers of the mid-brain). (Lalo, Gilbertson and Doyle) The use of biofeedback allows the creation of an artifact, although this is most commonly seen as charts, in some cases this data is presented to the user in the form of tones or images. These tones and images change as the user reaches their goal state. (American Cancer Society) This will create an opportunity for the subject to revisit the mindset and give an instance of reflection as well as track progress in treatment.

**Holosync & Brainwave Music Therapy.** Both of these use binaural beats to influence the functions of the brain. Holosync presents the user with a combination of sound stimuli. These sounds consist of natural elements, such as water flow, and tonal values in the range of the brain waves. In studies these beats have been proven to have the ability to effect both spatial perception and stereo auditory recognition, resulting in increases in activity in various portions brain. (Dobie and Norton) Similarly, Brainwave Music Therapy follows the same concept of “frequency follows”. The difference with Brainwave Music Therapy is that the tones the patient listens to are generated from their own brain activity that has been recorded via Electroencephalography (EEG) during relaxed and alert states. The patient then listens to this music daily/nightly. The mind is able to recognize the audio as its own sound and slows down, soothing itself by its own sounds. Studies using this method with students experiencing anxiety, depression and insomnia demonstrated a success in relieving symptoms in 82-85% of students in Russia during the 1990s. (Brain Music Treatment Center) Recently, this method of therapy has been gaining popularity. All of this rhythmic data recorded from the body is known as biofeedback.

**Water/Ocean Therapy.** Water/hydro-therapy has been used throughout time dating back to Egyptian, Greek and Roman times. (Metcalfe, Life of Vincent Priessnitz, Founder of Hydropathy) In 1954, John C. Lilly, a neuro-psychiatrist, began using isolation tanks, which allowed the patient to be treated totally submerged in water. With modifications, the patients began floating in salt water, allowing the activity in the alpha and beta to subside and increase theta activity, which corresponds to calming sleep activity. (Lilly and Gold, Tanks for the Memories: Flotation Tank Talks Gateway Books & Tapes) Currently, many organizations have taken this concept and applied it to a larger scale, the ocean.
In Wallace J. Nichols book Blue Mind, he immersed himself underwater wearing an Electroencephalography (EEG) device. The external stimulus of being underwater caused a series of changes in his biometric feedback. Hydrotherapy is not only used to treat anxiety but also, depression, autism, pain management, and sleep disorders. Wheels 2 Water is a non-profit organization that facilitates people with spinal cord injuries to experience surfing. (Testaverde Fund). The Jimmy Miller Foundation treats veteran soldiers who suffer from PTSD with a series of surf sessions followed by group therapy sessions on the beach afterward. (Jimmy Miller Foundation) Surfers For Autism organization specializes in treating children on the autistic spectrum. (Surfers for Autism) Many of their participants find a sense of ease because there is a consistent pattern in which the water behaves. Surf For All, which is run by the Skudin family in Long Beach, New York, encompasses all of these groups and does outreach for all people. (Skudin Surf)

**Electrotherapy.** Electrotherapy has been seen as a treatment for mental disorders throughout history. During the 18th Century Giovanni Aldini experimented with applying low intensity electrical stimulation to the galvanic head current. It was through these experiments, both on him-self and others, that he was able to successfully treat melancholy. (Zaghi, Acar and Hultgren) Modern day physicians still use this method of stimulation in the treatment of anxiety, depression and pain management by using a device known as an Alpha-Stim. The user places electrodes behind the bottom of their ears, and stimulates a portion of nerve endings in the brainstem. As the electrical currents stimulate these nerves triggering the release of serotonin, the chemical balance and electrical activity of the brain begins to alter. (Alpha-Stim) The change in these nerves behavior begins to affect others like a domino effect. (News Medical) This process, called neuromodulation, continues until the user reaches an alpha, or relaxed state.

###2.5 Treating Anxiety Through Non-Mobile Technology.
These treatments share a common theme of changing some aspect of behavior, either physiological or cognitive, to promote a healthier way of living with anxiety. The key to living a healthy life is one’s behavior. Recently, there has become a public push for living a healthy lifestyle, encouraging the public to use technology to aid their their life style change. This technology, designed to change human behavior through persuasuion and social influence, is known as Pervasive technology. Applications can be seen as pervasive technologies when they are used as tools, media and/or social actors. Before exploring the enviornment needed for a successful behavior to change, an exploration of technology used to aid in the treatment of anxiety is needed.

**Deepak Chopra’s LeelaTM.** Deepak Chopra’s LeelaTM, developed by THQ games, is a video game for both Wii and Xbox platforms that utilizes user’s body gestures to create a meditational environment. Within this game there are two ways to create this aesthetic, chakra-based meditation and “ambient oasis”. (Deepak Chopra n.d.) Each chakra represents energy centers within different sections of the body. There are seven different skills included in each of the chakra meditations; these movements encourage the user to focus on both their breathing and body movements, allowing the body to enter a meditative/calm state. The “ambient oasis” (Deepak Chopra n.d.) is a guided meditation for the user to experience. By allowing the conditions (sound and visuals) of the environment to change, it inspires the user to adjust their body subconsciously to reach a higher sense of tranquility. Overall this game uses natural rhythms within the body, such as breathing, “to cultivate a more creative harmonious and balanced life through play.” (Deepak Chopra n.d.) A video of sample game play can be found at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_x_foicedKk

**Flow.** Flow, developed by ThatGameCompany, is a Sony PlayStation (PS) and PC game in which the user controls the movements of a water-based organism through different levels of its environment. Within these levels the organism is able to consume other creatures, allowing for its own evolution as well as, allowing for its deeper journey through the game. Other organisms/creatures will attack it and diminish its growth. Once the organism finishes its journey through the depths of evolution, the user begins at the top layer again with a different organism. This gameplay is accompanied with a soothing instrumental increases the hydraulic presences within the game. Utilizing the advancements in development of the PS3 controllers, movements are made by shifting and rotating the controller in physical space. (Sony Playstation n.d.)

**Guru Meditation.** Guru Meditation began as a game for the traditional Atari VCS (2600) system. Users are encouraged to sit or stand quietly. As the user sits in a meditative crossed legged pose, they must remain perfectly still. As they remain in this position, the guru avatar rises. If the guru avatar begins to drop, indicating the user has moved; the user can recover by remaining still once more. When the avatar has levitated for a period of time a timer starts. In the traditional version, there are two ways to interact with this game; one is using the positioning of the Atari joystick controller, and the other a peripheral board for the users to sit on. (Bogost n.d.) This platform could not be tested for this study due to the rare peripherals and platform; instead the application for I-device (iPhone/iPad/iPod) development, recreated by Ian Bogost, was accessible. In that version the user must, as in the traditional version, must remain as quiet and still as possible. With thumbs pressed upon the screen, the avatar ascends and drops similar to the traditional game. This application does not allow the I-device to be utilized for other activities when playing, leaving the user disconnected from the “outside” stimuli introduced from an I-device normally. A video of sample game play can be found at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN2BV7zo3tA

**Headspace.** Headspace is both an online application and a mobile application that uses meditation and mindfulness to train the mind for a healthier life. This tool maps out each users progress in a timeline, allowing for a personal attachment to the application as well as a clear visual of their goals and accomplishments. Once the user completes the foundation stage, they can pursue the completion of the health, performance, relationships and pro stages. In the relationship stage users are become more mindful of their own reaction to others. The health stage provides help for those with mental health problems, encouraging them to help themselves through meditation. This is all designed with light colors and simple vector based art. Two other features include SOS and On-The-Go. These features include exercises for emergencies and activities that can be done while commuting, or eating lunch. Notifications remind the user to utilize the meditational tools and journal their time. This application encourages community support by allowing users to track and encourage other’s progress.  As the user progresses in their goals and adds community as a subscribed member, they are rewarded with points that can be traded in for gift cards.

Although this application did not have many users review it, it has received a 5 star rating in the iTunes store. Users have raved that its notifications have been able to keep them on schedule as well as teaching them skills needed to meditate. Users complained that the subscription was expensive, but the application was effective. An overview of the application can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEpOF7vUymc

**Basis Sync.** The Basis application is both a mobile and web based application for users to track and change their unhealthy habits. This application requires the users to wear the basis fitness tracker to record their biometric information throughout the day. The user then wirelessly synchronizes this information with the application. The application gives the user to have a unique insight on their own behaviors, providing tools to help them modify them. Habits the user wants to modify can are chosen through the application in exchange for points. Points are earned by completing the goals set for oneself through behavior change. The user can view the progress on these goals in addition to patterns and overviews of their own activities (and biometric readings). Although it is necessary to sign up for this service, the application and subscription are free.

This application was given a 3 star rating in the iTunes store. Users felt the application was able to provide them with in-depth breakdowns of daily activates, but needed features to enhance technical difficulties.

###2.6 Success of Persuasive Technology.
Behavior modification is similar to B.F. Skinner’s theory of operant conditioning. This theory was based off of Edward Thorndike’s Law of effect, or what is referred to as reinforcement. (Thorndike) Thorndike’s law states, if a behavior was followed by a feeling of satisfaction, this behavior would be repeated, if it was followed by an unpleasant feeling, the behavior would not be repeated. (Thorndike)

Through research using laboratory rats, Skinner identified a behavior is followed by one of three types of responses. Environmental factors that had no effect on the repetition of a behavior were known as neutral operands. Reinforcers were factors that affected the behavior by either increasing or decreasing it. Finally, if a factor decreased the probability of a behavior ever happening again, it was labeled a punisher. (B. F. Skinner)

Successful behavior modification relies on the balance between positive and negative reinforcement, as well as tokens and shapers. Tokens are secondary reinforcers that can be traded for other things. (B. Skinner) For example, in many mobile applications one may earn points for a certain task, in the Basis application one will earn points for each challenge met. The points can then be traded in to unlock other items; in this example the Basis application allows the user to unlock new challenges.  Shapers allow the user to take steps in reaching the target behavior. (B. Skinner) For example, if the challenge was to reach 10,000 steps everyday for a week, and the user did not complete that challenge every day, they would receive a portion of points for the days that they did.

In order for pervasive technologies to successfully change one’s behavior motivation, ability and a trigger element must be present. This can be simply broken down into having the desire, resources, and the prompt to change. It is believed by B.J. Fogg, that if all of these are present, the user will act upon the goal behavior at that time. And if one of these elements is missing, the user will not. While many mobile applications do offer ability and trigger, the software must follow the guidelines of applied behavior analysis (ABA or behavior modification) inorder to keep the user motivated. In order to create a sucessful long term change to ones behavior, this must be done consistently over the course of an extended period to make a significant lifestyle change. (Haynes, Stevenson and Grothaus)

###2.7 Mobile Aides for Anxiety.
In addition to Headspace and Basis, other mobile applications seek to help users change their behavior to a calmer, healthier demeanor. These applications focus on guided meditational aspects and building coping skills, such as breathing exercises. Each of these applications encourages behavior change in different ways, with the common trigger of always being available. As portable aides these applications have an advantage over stand-alone tools, these applications can offer behavior modification methods throughout the day no matter where the user is.

Equanimity Equanimity Meditation Timer & Tracker is a clear and simple meditation tool. This application provides details for each meditational session the user has. This application records user’s sitting times, sitting notes in a journal, and graphical displays of tracking. The user has the ability to take notes after their sitting as well as read notes from past sittings. This information can be exported into an email or spreadsheet. Simple graphics give the user a status report of the frequency of meditation along with their own progress in bar graph form. To keep users motivated to continue meditating consistently badge reminders will count the number of days between meditation sittings. This application can be used along side of another meditational application, as it works in the background allowing the user to multitask. A gong tone will notify the user when their meditation time sitting has been reached.

Equanimity, ranked 4+ stars in the iTunes store, is one of the top meditational applications purchased. User’s appreciate that it is not intrusive, and simple to use. Other then some technical difficulties, users enjoy this application and feel as though it helps them consistently meditate.

**Breathe2Relax.** Breathe2Relax is a mobile application available on both Android and iOS devices that provides users with tools needed to manage their stress. Upon opening the app, the users is asked to customize their experience by selecting scenery, music, as well as timings for breathing. This application encourages the user to use diaphragmatic breathing, deep breathing which expands the stomach. This type of breathing exercise is frequently used in meditational exercises to help with mood stabilization, anger control, and to lower stress or anxiety. When the user presses the exercise button, they are asked to gage how they are feeling (stressed or calm) before the exercise begins. Once the exercise begins, images from the scenery they chose appear and change with each inhale/exhale. A bar on the side gauges the users breath by using the inhale times. There is an option to shorten or lengthen the times for both inhale and exhale as needed. Each time it is used the session is documented, and progress can be viewed by the user in the form of a graph. Similar to Sessions, Breathe2Relax was designed to be used as a stand-alone stress/anxiety reduction tool, or can be used with a professional heath care provider.

Breathe2Relax has a 4+ star rating in the iTunes store. Many of the users have stated that it has helped them alleviate stress, but complain that calibrating times for breathing is a bit tricky. Users also documented audio and visual technical issues with the application.  An overview video of this application can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEZ1dvZuJYc

**Worry Box.** This Android only application, Worry Box, allows the users to lock their anxieties away in a virtual box, to leave them free from these worries. Similar to a journal application, the user will type in the answers to a series of questions in a form like interface. Some questions include: titling the worry, description, and listing coping techniques. This form walks the user from a personal point of view to a distant one, allowing the worry to be set aside instead of consuming the user. Once the form has been completed the user can lock it away in their virtual worry box. Although the box is locked with a password for the user’s protection, these worries can be reviewed at any time. The application also gives the user the option of listening to calming music to encourage meditational techniques, such as but not limited to deep breathing.

Although many users feel that this application is worthwhile to have on their devices, many want more information on how to alleviate the worry completely rather then just setting it aside. This application has a 4+ star rating on the Google store.

*Fig21. Screen grabs of Worry Box provided by https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.excelatlife.worrybox&hl=en*

**I Can Be Fearless.** I Can Be Fearless is another mobile application geared at self-help and improvements. This application requires the user to download session content pertaining to their area of self-improvement. For anxiety and stress relief, users listen to a man’s calming voice repeats a mantra encouraging the user to relax. This guided meditation, explains how listening can relax the muscles, as well as the brain reaction to conscious and unconscious listening. Additional ambience sounds that can be played in addition to his voice can also be downloaded. This application can be used without an account, but if the user creates an account they are able to increase their level each time they listen to the mantra. In addition to increasing levels, creating a profile allows the user a deeper insight by allowing them to view a log, and personal statistics.

Although this application has not received as many reviews on the iTunes store as the previous discussed applications, it has received a 4 star rating. The user reviews state that the application’s mantra is calming, but the cost of each session, and to download additional moods does not encourage users to continue use.

**GPS for the Soul.** GPS for the soul offers guided meditations in the form of a mobile application for both iOS and Android users. This application originally required users to gauge their stress levels by using a heart rate monitor before using the guided mediation features. With a recent upgrade, this is no longer a feature. Now upon the start of this application, a simple menu allows users to choose between creating a custom guide and viewing a prefabricated guide. If the user chooses to view, a new menu appears that lists different guides with a description and still image alongside the author’s name. The background consists of a sky image with shades of light green animating through it. Once the user chooses a guide, by tapping on it, the guide loads and plays. Images with inspirational type appear on the screen, a subtle circle can be seen on the edges of the screen, and becomes larger and smaller as if it was breathing with the user. Transitions between the images and type are not always smooth. Each session is brief and lasts about 1 – 2 minutes. Once the guide has completed, a screen appears telling the user the guide has been completed and allows the user to share the guide with others. The guides included all center on nature and play off the concept of harmony and balance. The activity feed, encourages connection to others for support by inviting users to view others feelings and recommendations for guides.

GPS for the Soul received a rating of 2 stars on the iTunes store. Users complained that the heart rate monitor was a useful feature to evaluate their feelings, and changed the effectiveness of the application. Others complained that the guides were often choppy and ended abruptly. Sample interaction with this application can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C14ik8TLQA

##3 METHODOLOGY

###3.1 Grid of Nine.
The concept of Sessions originated as a series of projects. The baseline concept of using technology to manipulate one’s physiological abilities was broken down into three domains: biofeedback to offer insight into the brain and its functions, synchronizations of physiological rhythms to natural rhythms, and the utilization of light therapy to enhance performance. Each of these domains were broken down further asking how each could be explored, as well as in what form it would take.

*Fig. 23 Biofeedback grid of nine*

Biometrics To Offer Insight Combining both biometric and ocean therapies, led me to the realization of a virtual surf game. In this game the user would wear a device that would store specific biofeedback from the brain, breath/heartrate, and temperature.  This data changes as the user responds to stimuli. The data is collected throughout the day until the user returns home and syncronizes the worn device to the surf game. The game’s imersive enviornment is controlled with the biofeedback taken throughout the day. Once at home the user has the option to play with live data or previously recorded data. If the user chooses to play a live session, the sound and speed in which each set of waves travel is based on current breath and heart rate. Brain data from high alpha and theta waves would control the conditions of the waves. As the user was more relaxed (increase of theta) the waves would be cleaner, when they were more anxious (increase of high alpha) the waves would be choppier. If the user chose to revisit a previously recorded data set, meditation levels throughout gameplay would need to maintain a high threshold for the conditions of the enviornment to calm. The creation of this virtual enviornment gives the user an opportunity to conquer “anxieties” and ride the waves to a feeling of release from the day. Users would keep track of progress and revisit previous data-sets as desired.

This game leads the user to experience benefits of both biofeedback in therapy, as well as the benefits of Surf Therapy. The largest benefit to this game is that users are able to keep track of progress promoting a change in day to day behavior, making progress and use quantitative not just qualitative. The creation of a virtual wave artifact will offer insight as to how the user feels at a particular moment during the day, each dataset will conform to the norms of each player, not the norms of a larger population. Finally, game play gives the user an advantage over adversity by allowing control in the current moment to ride waves caused by daily stress with fair conditions. This gives the user a sence of release and accomplishment.

*Fig. 24 Circadian Rhythms grid of nine*

Synchronizations of Physiological Rhythms The effects of musical tones on one’s biological rhythms, based off of biological rhythm studies and Brainwave Music Therapy, lead me to the exploration of recreating musical tone with our own body rhythms. In this realization I will construct a series of music boxes. One would be created using brainwave input to create the teeth, which would be played. Each channel of input would control a different note. The same is done for other body metrics such as breath and heart rate. All data taken from the body would be influenced by the audio rhythms of the ocean soundtrack. The final music box is created with data from the ocean waves (creating the soundtrack listened to), thus creating the connection between the body’s rhythms and natural rhythms of our environment.

The effects of this piece are still unclear. Rhythmic changes to the body take an extended period of time exposed to new stronger rhythms, the data recorded may or may not synchronize with the ocean’s rhythm in the time allotted.

*Fig. 24 Light therapy grid of nine*

Utilization of Light Therapy In the circadian rhythm, light is critical. Light is the external cue for these instinctive, biological functions. An example of a cycle is the sleep/wake cycle. This cycle begins when the sun comes up and our bodies wake. While the sun is up humans exhibit moments of best coordination, alertness, etc. When the sun sets our bodies prepare for slumber. Sleep is just as important to the body as the wake time. Lack of sleep has lead to depression, anxiety and other mental disorders. (Armitage, Hoffmann and Rush, Biological rhythm disturbance in depression: temporal coherence of ultradian sleep EEG rhythms.) With this knowledge, I revisited forms of water/hydrotherapy that have been used throughout time, focusing on submersion and isoloation tanks. The final project concept was to recreate an isolation tank with the Occulus Rift. Sensors would be placed on extremedies to simulate the sound effects of movement within the tank.

Developments. Water is a crucial part of our “reality”. Consciously or subconsciously, the effects of water are constantly part of our thoughts throughout the day, whether it is eating, cleaning, etc. By combining biofeedback with water, the hypothesis of how we incorporate technology to manipulate one’s physiological abilities to change human behavior can be explored. While each project is still a potential for development, the surf game was chosen to move into development first.

###3.2 Prototypes.
Building this calming experience using the physiological rhythms body has proven challenging.  Not only are there massive learning curves to keep up with new technologies as they develop, but also finding viable solutions for water as an artifact to create a theraputic response. In order to build upon this project, prototypes were set up to test different aspects. These are core, audience, aesthetic, technology and vertical slice prototypes. The feedback from each further shaped the development and direction of Sessions.

To begin, Sessions, formerly named brainwaves, was tested as a fully immersive experience. The original concept was to use an Oculus Rift to view ocean waves that were influenced by the user’s brainwaves. The user would then be able to navigate through the waves by exerting control over their breathing rate and balance. Core prototypes were set up to test the thereputic effect produced by these primary functions.

*1st Core Prototype:* To give the user the experience of being fully immersed by a barrel wave, two large blue plastic sheets were taped together with one end secured to the top of a fan. The fan was placed pointing upward about waist high. The speed of the fan is increased when the users anxiety is increased. At the peak of high anxiety the wave is blown into the shape of a barrel wave that is large enough that users can navigate through it. A skateboard was chosen as the means for the user to navigate through this space. A helmet is worn both for safety and to represent the biometric device in which the user will need to wear.

*Fig. 25 Photographs and diagram of barrel wave prototype.*

Testing began with asking the user how they were feeling and adjusting the fan to blow the wave accordingly. Many users were apprehensive of riding the skateboard through the wave, even when they were lead slowly through. There was one user who just sat under the wave for an extended period of time. Although users were intrigued by the creation of the wave effect with the fan, not many people wanted to physically interact with the wave.

Other feedback recorded led to the exploration of when this experience would be used, how people would use it, and what devices could be used to capture the necessary data without causing more anxiety.

*2nd Core Prototype:* Modifications were made to the initial prototype to reflect the capturing of quantitative biometric data throughout the day. In this instance paper prototypes were made to help the user navigate throught the menu. The main menu begain with a login screen, this screen gave the user the ability to login with their own profile or to create a new one. Once logged in, the user was able tosyncronize new data collected to the database, revisit previous day’s data (as both game play and chart forms) and progress made, as well as view/play current data. A small headband was worn by the user to represent the Emotive Insight. When the user chose to play or view data the appropriate visual was shown on a larger 20x30 paper. Wave heights were created with recorded anxiety levels throughout the day while conditions of the tides were created by current biometrics. While test users enjoyed concept of feeling a release from revisiting high anxiety times to renavigate them calmer, many questioned how long game play would be since the data was recorded all day. It also did not appear many people would play this for more then ten minutes or so at the end of their days.

*Fig. 26 Photographs and map of menu for second core prototype.*

It became clear that although this was originally thought to be an immersive installation type game it needed to be accessible to the target audience, without causing additional anxieties with the use of certain technologies, such as the Oculus. The combersome headgear in addition to biometric devices would certainly put anyone in an uncomfortable position regardless if they have anxiety. Yes! Honing in on the target audience needs, the piece took on its current pocket therapist application. The application became mobile, something that people could carry with them and use throughout the day, instead of just ten minutes or so at the end of their day.

*1st Aesthetic Prototype:* As the presentation of this application became smaller, the visual grew more important. In a mobile application, there was not much room for the features that were originally planned. This required the interface to be broken down further only including the most essential functions. Using a photograph of an iPhone 4/5, a sample interface was pieced together using Adobe Photoshop and screengrabs of ocean footage taken earlier. This allowed the user to have a gateway to a realiztic looking ocean and enviornment.

*Fig. 27 Aesthetic prototypes for the mobile application*

Although the mobile application had the ability for users to access at any point, there needed to be a tracking system for the user to measure progress. Using a similar method, the mobile screen shots were created. This interface allowed the access to all the options of the original menu prototyped. The left side of the screen gave an indication of anxiety levels throughout a time period.  The right side offered an ocean visual for the specific time of day selected. Users were also able to replay their levels throughout the day by scroll through biometric data in wave form at the bottom of the screen. By selecting a period of time, the visual on the right changed to refect this. On the visual, there is a button to allow the user to play this period of time full screen with current biometric data to modify their conditions.

*Fig. 28 Aesthetic prototypes for the desktop application*

*1st Audience Prototype:* In order to test this concept along with the realistic look and feel, an audience prototype was created. Four different videos were chosen to represent different states of mind. These videos were both shot on a Sony AS30, as well as pulled from internet footage of hurricanes. After their import into Adobe Premire, they were edited into loops, so they could be played unending. Once each loop was created the videos were exported as a series of images. Using a batch function in Photoshop they were then resized to the aspect ratio of the iphone 5. Each set of video images were then organized into their own atlas folders and imported into an iOS application and coded to change with the use of a stepper button using Apple’s Software Development Kit (SDK). The user could change the view depending on how they were feeling. The higher the stepper button went, the more chaotic/stormy the waves looked. A sample interaction with this application can be found at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oR-ryMcKtU

*Fig. 29 Screen Grabs of the four different anxiety and non-anxiety stages created. *

When testing this prototype, the videos did not play smoothly, causing some delayed reactions in enviornment changes. Also, some testers did not feel at ease with all the water transformations, as the anxiety and chaos rose, they felt more anxious not less. Two users suggested using a constant sound to subdue the anxiety that is provoked by the chaos created. To enhance the flow of the ocean, multiple technology prototypes were created. Both used different techniques to try and accomplish the same look.

*1st Technology Prototype:* This iteration was designed for desktop viewing. Open Frameworks was used to simulate water movement using particles and springs. Once this wireframe was set up,  different forces for gravity, and current that could be used with biometric modifiers to create different wave shapes.  Sample video of this animation can be found at http://youtu.be/XRRbaAAyCiA

*Fig. 30 Screen grab of the particle and spring framework created.*

Unfortunately, when modifiers were added the wave did not manipulate as desired.  Moving forward, another iteration was created using a plane.

*2nd Technology Prototype:* To build the plane in order for it to be manipulated, it was constructed by a series of triangles, drawn as a wireframe in Open Frameworks. Perlin noise was then applied to each point in the mesh, updating the movement in each frame with time as a growing variable. At first, the noise was not representative of water, with modifications it slowly started to take a more natural form. This required the noise on each axis to be multiplied by a smaller percentage to create more subtle movements.  A sampling of each movement can be found at http://youtu.be/_eA7Ed7NwVo ,  http://youtu.be/eoXym0N06EM , and http://youtu.be/m3xxZFP2DOI

*Fig. 31 Screen grabs of the oscillating planes created.*

Although, the mesh’s flexibility for flowing movement increased, texturing it to add a realiztic look to water seemed problematic. Further investigation into shaders was needed.

*3rd Technology Prototype:* Using vertex and fractal shaders to control the color and space of each pixel, the creation of simple 2 dimensional water movement was created. Once again in Open Frameworks, an image was drawn to an fbo (or internal memory), once the shader was applied, the pixels in the image were transposed to a new position. This was redrawn in a loop to create the a water like movement. Using just the vertex shader, the water moved almost mechanically and less organic. Adding a vertex shader to apply perlin noise to the water’s texture gave a viable solution.

A sample video of these shader noise effects can be found at http://youtu.be/2re1HWzp_LI and http://youtu.be/j034OMrfuv8

*Fig. 32 Screen grabs of 2 dimensional water shaders created.*

After seeing how fast the shaders rendered it was clear that this was the route to pursue. Further investigation is needed  into creating animated terrains with shaders inorder to create this piece. The largest issue left to address with technology was if this was feasible to create in a mobile application using open frameworks.

*4th Technology Prototype:* This prototype began to explore using the iPhone’s processing ability to render and change these shaders and meshes as the application required.  A simple senerio was created using the iOS development version of Open Frameworks, utilizing a previous sketch created using the desktop version. In this program, a number of triangles were created to rotate around an invisible radius. The amount of  triangles and their color was conrolled with inputs from graphic user interface inputs. By increasing the triangles and changing the color, tested the immediate response and processing power of the iphone. A video of this processing test can be viewed at http://youtu.be/zcnTuWD48so

*Fig. 33 Screen grab of the iOS processing test application*

Unfortunately, shaders are handled differently when dealing with mobile devices, due to the nature of their video controller. This requires further research.

*5th Technology Prototype:* As technical knowledge was gained, the next test incorporated the use of textures onto a 3D plane. This plane was manipulated with the motion of a sin wave over time, and did not use external inputs. A second iteration of this prototype included the animation of the texture map used using the same algorhythm.  These texture animation tests can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtGdu09CP8I , http://youtu.be/oFFOVU-vH8A and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udWmkNzTDV4

*Fig. 34 Screen grab of the iOS water texture tests*

*1st Vertical Slice:* To portray this application as a theraputic application, it was necessary to include sound. An ambience of beach and wave sounds were mixed using a free online sound library freesfx, and Protools. After exporting the mixed sound files as mp3 files, they were imported into the iOS OpenFrameworks programs. Next a new texture was added to have the appearance of  more authentic water.

Unfortunately, there were some large scale bugs in this prototype. The ofxThinkGear addon did not work with xCode 5.1, the version of xCode that was used to develop on thus far and the texture size and placement caused seems/pixelation in the texture map.

*Fig. 35 Screen grab of the initial vertical slice*

*Playtech:* The vertical Slice was adapted into an iPad version as well and tested during Playtech, an event in which highschool children and their parents visit The New School to play test games in development. For each user interested, a Neurosky was placed on their head, and it was explained how it would gather brain activity. Headphones were also given to the user to wear. Then the application was turned on and “syncronized” with the head set worn by the user. Since the application was not set up to receive any external data, the user would see the simulation programmed in motion tests, the user was able to hear ambient water sound in this playtest.

Although there was the Neurosky was not transmitting data, many users claimed to have made the wave become calmer or more active. A few users challenged each other to see who could get the waves more active. Not one user claimed it was only a simulation and not live brainwave data. Although a handfull of users felt like they was being over come by the waves. One also claimed to feel sea sick. While some users sat for a longer period of time, the majority of users did not exceed five minutes of interacting with this set up. All users who wore the headphone claimed to be relaxed before they left. The users who did not, had trouble focusing on the waves, and used the application very briefly.

*Fig. 36 Photographs of high schoolers playtesting Sessions*

*Activity Monitor Comparrison:* Emotiv, Neurosky and Open BCI were all compared. Both Open BCI and Neurosky were tested hands on. Open BCI was eliminated because not only was it not Open Frameworks ready, but it was not consumer ready and required the use of wet sensors (making it hard for a user to wear daily without much effort). A Neurosky Mindwave Mobile was also obtained and tested. An Open Frameworks addon, called ofxThinkgear, made it easy to communucate data through bluetooth. The delay in transmission was problematic.  The Emotiv Insight was the top choice, as it was designed to be worn daily and also had compatibility to Open Frameworks. Unfortunately, its release date is late this year. Conversations to acquire one early on for prototyping were started, but it is unclear if Emotiv can meet the request. The Neurosky Mindwave Mobile was chosen to use in the interim.

Similarly to the headset research, a side by side comparison was also made for the Gear Fit, Gear Live, Fit Bit, Up, iWatch and Basis. The Gear Fit was eliminated due to lack of documentation about its proprietary operating system. A Samsung Gear Live, running on Andriod Wear, came into my possestion. Research was started for development on this platform, but seemed it’s set up was complicated and clunky and there was not enough time to thouroughly investigate different applications to develop for andriod. The Up and Fit Bit did not have the capabilities to gather all the data neccessary. The iWatch was the ideal platform, even though it does not have a galvanic skin sensor. Since is not slated to release until early 2015, this is temporarily not an option for development. The Basis, the only tracker to have all of the necessary readings, was chosen as the activity tracker to pursue.

At the time, the research done around the biometric technologies seemed to be a success, but when these pieces were added to the veritcal slice prototype the research felt incomplete. The ofxThinkGear addon did not work with the newer version of xcode, and the tracker did not have an accessable API, as advertise.  Incorporating the information needed from these devices was problematic. More research was needed in order to make this aspect of this project a success.

*Test Group:* The same prototype was also tested with select individuals diagnosed with anxiety disorders. Riley, who has generalized and situatonal anxiety, carried the beta version without external data input with him for a day. He was told that the data imported from his Basis model B1 activity tracker was creating the waves. During his use, he was bothered by the angle of horizon, explaining he felt like he was being over come by the waves.  He also wanted to be able to view the waves in horizontal view rather hen just a vertical form. The sound however calmed Riley so much he fell asleep while listening to it. Due to more severe anxiety disorders, other members of the test group will need supervision from professional mental health workers.

*Fig. 40 Photographs of Riley playtesting Sessions*

*6th Technology Prototype:* A gui was introduced into the test application to calculate the compensation needed to create the proper landscape view when rotated. The gui also aided in maping input to the wave’s features. A workaround to the ofxThinkGear was created. In order to have the Neurosky recognized as an input, the developer bundle supplied by Neurosky must be copied directly into the application. To do this, the debug file in the bin folder must be opened (as a directory), and the bundle must be copied into the Mac folder. A sample video of the Neurosky interacting with the 3d waves can be found at http://youtu.be/ErZKiFuU6TM

*Fig. 41 Neurosky tes with 3D Waves*

*2nd Vertical Slice:* In this version, the texture was repaired and modified, as well as the angle of view. A landscape view was added. Unfortunately, after an upgrade to iOS 8.0, the landscape no longer worked correctly. This was recalibrated, and recoded into the application. A video sample can be found at http://youtu.be/4u-YyE_fPtc and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y8h8379biA

*Fig. 42 Revised prototype screen shots*

*2nd Aesthetic Prototype:* In response to user testing feedback, the aesthetic was revisited. As an application the interface had to clearly communicate the personal and therapeutic aspects of the application. As the interface design began, it became clear that the functions and features of the application needed to be mapped out further. How would user’s connect their devices, was an account needed, and what other features if any are offered were al questions that needed to be answered in order to continue the build.

Similar applications were investigated. Each was evaluated for its ease of use and aesthetic properties. Data collected was put into the initial interface design. A landing page was created using simple vector art as simplified waves, a sample logo was also created using a san serif font, in all lowercase letters in an effort not to overwhelhm the user. Color schemes were based off of color studies. With an asortment of color schemes, a paper prototype was built and tested. While users found the interface easy to navigate, many said it felt clunky and flat. A video sample can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMI1JUyfdgs

*Fig. 43 Color schemes in vector art for landing page. *

*Fig. 44 Vector art tested for user feedback.*

*3rd Asthetic Prototype:* Revisiting motivations which inspired this project lead to the replacement of vector art with a personal photograph taken during sunrise while surfing. The image not only included the blue color scheme which was seen as calming, but had hints of warmer colors to offer depth. Buttons were revised into semi-transparent offering more fluidity for the background art. This theme was carried out through all of the applications sections. While reviewing the application’s functions, a journal section was added to enable the user to post notes on possible triggers, or accomplishments. This interface was well received by test subjects.

*Fig. 45 Revised application design*

*7th Technology Prototype:* Due to the incompatibilities of the iOS SDK and OpenFrameworks, the technical builds were haulted. The project was no longer able to be complied, or tested due to missing library links. When those links were repaired, xCode prevented the application from runing due to system errors. While OpenFrameworks promised a fix to these issues in their next release, an alternate solution was needed in order to continue testing. This lead to the development of a website to be used on a mobile phone. This solution opened testing to users not only using iOS devices but also Android.

A quick mock-up was build using Adobe Muse to transfer the mobile applicaton designs into HTML and CSS. During testing many users visited the site on their computers as well, which required a fully resonsive site to be built to accommodate their use.

*Fig. 46 Mobile application design converted to HTML & CSS*

*4th Aesthetic Prototype:* The build of a responsive website required the application to not only function as a mobile application but also a full screen web service. The mobile design was modified again to accommodate all platforms.

*Fig. 47 Mobile sized site revised as full website*

*7th Technology Prototype:* In order to accommodate a build this version, the core needs were transferred from c to web based languages. There was still a need for a database to store account access and biometric data, as well as journal entries. To develop and test database and biometric feeds a webserver was setup by installing apache, php 5.3 and mysql 4.3 on the local drive of a machine. Upon install using myphpadmin, a database was created. Two tables were included, one for login information, and the other with login attempts – to ensure that the login was secure. Using PHP a number of scripts were created (one for the initial database credentals to add users and perform queries, and others to connect, register, login, logout, place a salt on the password and perform queries). These scripts were utilized in other PHP files and HTML documents to protect content for user’s only.

*Fig. 48 Sql used to create table and columns for login access.*

*Fig. 49 Sample page of content without login accepted. *

*8th Technology Prototype:* With the database accepting and providing data, the build had to be coded as responsive. Detailed research into responsive design was completed, including tools such as Bootstrap. CSS was coded for the smallest resolution first, and then using viewport setting positioning and images were replaced based on the size of the device. In addition, the back end database script was added to the pages and tested. A sample of the responsive design can be seen at http://youtu.be/nCkdhD6PLxE

*Fig. 50 Responsive design of interface for both mobile and full screen *

*9th Technology Prototype:* Crucial to Sessions’ development the virtual ocean still needed to be translated into web programming. Although Unity was considered, its applications require plugin’s that not all mobile devices would have access to. Shader’s were also considered but again, there was a concern that using gl would not be accessible on all devices. The largest concern with programing the waves for web was the ability for these waves to be developed to be modular and responsive on all devices. At this point it seemed most logical to begin with JavaScript and its THREE.js library.  Simple exercises were completed in order to test if the graphics would translate across devices.

The first test was the creation of a cube with texture. The second was the implementation of texture as a rotating sky. The sky was textured using a panoramic photo of the sky. Adobe Photoshop was used to edit it into 6 seemless sides of the cube that held it. Both of these were easily implemented and viewable on mobile devices.

*Fig. 51 Early tests with THREE.js*

Proceeding onward, the basic water shader using WebGL was tested on a mobile device. After it successfully ran, this shader was then modified to apply a sin movement to a matrix of points on plane geometry. All aspects of the shader and the sin animation were made to be reponsive to user input using a gui. A sample video of this interaction can be viewed at http://youtu.be/uT5pDEb5kSo.

*Fig. 52 Shader water tests with GUI interface.*

*3nd Vertical Slice Prototype:* As the technology and aestetic evolved, it was time to create another vertical slice prototype to test user reaction to live biometric input. Revisiting technology tested earlier, a neurosky was used to gather user brainwave data. To avoid lag in transmission, node.js was used to provide a live streaming api off of a local server. Once the data was emitted, the variables for Alpha and Theta waves were imported into the variables that controlled ocean conditions, giving the geometric plane height as the user began to feel more anxious.

*Fig. 53 Neurosky water simulation tests at PlayTech.*

*Playtech:* The 3rd Vertical Slice was presented to users on a large monitor during Playtech during the Spring of 2015. During testing a Neurosky was placed on the user’s head, and it was explained how it would gather brain activity to make the water respond. Speakers were used to project the changing sounds of the enviornment as the user’s mind state changed.

Intrigued by the visual of a calm ocean, many users asked about the project. After explaining in a brief pitch moment, users volunteered to try it. Very few users wanted to know how the technology worked, they just wanted to see the change in water rhythm.
Although Sessions was set up next to a scary VR game, many users were able to sucessfully slow their minds down. Some users found it hard to slow their mind down to calm the water, especailly with the sounds from the neighboring game. All users who tested Sessions claimed to have felt as though they had control over the waves.

The revised horizon line and water view, left the users feeling calm and not overcome by the waves. No one complained of feeling sea-sick, as in previous testing. Many users sat for a longer period of time, and even stayed to watch others use the water simulation. Now it was time to continue production and gather biometeric data from the basis for everyday use.

*Fig. 54 Neurosky water simulation tests at PlayTech.*

*10th Technology Prototype:* Since the Basis Activity Trackers do not have an open API, work arounds were used to gather data. With the help of George Han and Bob Troia a PHP script was utilized to Scrape data from the Basis website. This script required a user account login and password, a date range and a format for file export. Using Cron commands in terminal, this script was automated to export metrics from the basis site every minute into a json file. Data in the json file could then be used to modify the waves. The large problem with this was the one minute delay on top of the import delay. A better method was needed inorder to have the users feel control, as they did when testing with the neurosky.

*Fig. 55 Basis water simulation tests.*

*11th Technology Prototype:* After the positive feedback during testing on a large screen, a virtual reality solution was revisited. With prior feedback taken into consideration, a less intrusive headset was needed. This lead to the development for Google Cardboard. Using the stereograph tutorial for THREE.js, a simpler version of water was created to be tested. While the geometric plane and algorithym did not display correctly, the simpler version was able to be used for testing.
Users were intrigued by the cardboard. Once they held it up to their eyes, they loved the feeling of looking around. One user claimed he felt he was on his surfboard. The cardboard was not as intrusive or heavy as the Oculus. Users felt more control over the use, and did not experience simulator sickness, as they had control over the device.

*Fig. 56 Basis water simulation tests.*
Final Protoype: Final modifications for the close of this semester were made to ensure Sessions would be all inclusive. This included running a server side node script to replace the php to gather Basis data, as well as completion of Sessions website. Sessions currently lives at https://sessions.parsons.edu. Updates for this project are ongoing and can be found at https://compagnb.wordpress.com. All code can be found at https://github.com/compagnb/compagnb_thesis2015.

##4 FINDINGS, REFLECTIONS, & NEXT STEPS

##4.1 Findings and Reflections.
*"I surf because... it keeps my life at an even keel, without it I would tip into oblivion.” –Andy Irons, I Surf Because (2010)*

Surfing is for size two California girls with sun-bleached hair, not me. In 2010, when my own anxiety was hindering me from leaving the house, one of my college professors dared me to take a surf lesson with her.  Begrudgingly, I accepted. I never expected to catch a wave; I never expected to stand up on a board; and I certainly never expected to love it. Love it might be too mild a word.

From the moment I caught that first ripple; I was hooked. Surfing became a sunrise ritual. Paddling out, battling the white water, and forcing myself to find a rhythm that would lead me to the break as well as the rhythm needed to remain on my board once at the break. Some days the water made it harder then others, spitting me back out onto the shore, and others it was an easy ride. Once at the break, looking out on the water anything could have happened; I was a small speck in this vast body of water. Somewhere along the way, I found the strength to make changes that were needed in my life and my anxiety began to disappear.

Entering into MFA Design and Technology, I noticed that my work had begun to include water as a theme, but seemed to be lacking something. I began to force myself to work without water as a theme, allowing an exploration biological art revolving around rhythms. For the most part, this seemed to abstract and clinical. Revisiting water as a theme gives my biological work balance, just as surfing balances my anxeity.

In order to make a difference with my work, I began with something I knew all too well – anxiety. To incorporate this into my focus required not only a self examination, but also a more in-depth look at the physiological effects and causes of anxiety. It was imperative to pinpoint what physiologically changed in a person when they had an attack, also if there were any tell tale signs (physiologically) prior to an attack. Much of this research involved the brain and its functioning. In an effort to include the most comprehansive study, I decided to stop taking Xanax for my own anxiety disorder and began to monitor my own biometric increases. This information helped shaped the required inputs for Sessions. Since the underlying attacks usually caused an increase in body temperature, heart rate, breath rate, and an increase in high alpha waves and a decrease in theta waves, these variables will create the enviornment.

In addition to looking at the causes, an exporation into the treatments were needed as well. With surfing taking such a large role in my lifestyle, I began to break down why it worked so well for not only me, but so many others. Comparing my own experience of surfing to other forms of treatments I began to draw parallels in feedback cycles and changing perpectives. It was clear that Sessions would combine water, biology and psychology through technology.
Sessions was not initally intended to be a mobile application, I felt as though users needed to be immersed in the imagery, as I was surfing, for it to be beneficial. I fought the concept of a mobile application for weeks, until I made my first conceptual presentation. As I stood infront of the class, heart pounding, head racing, I reached for the bar of surf wax that sat in my pocket. As I grabbed it I begain to relax, thinking of the ocean, my thoughts began to slow down. It was at this moment, I realized others needed a “bar of wax” as well.

Similarly to the change in platform, the design evolved into a more personal and thoughtful design. The original design for the mobile application only included a simple vector based art. However, this design could not convey the feeling I was trying to invoke the users to have while using it. The feeling that I have when sitting on the water at sunrise seemed to be one of a kind and hard to replicate, especially in an interface. As I struggled with the design elements, I revisited video and photographs taken while on the water at sunrise. It was clear that the colors and feeling captured in these photographs would be the root of Session’s design moving forward.

Although most prototyping has been done on the mobile platform, the design is completely responsive allowing for it to adapt with each users needs and desires. In order for Sessions to be a success, it need to be modular and accessible when ever the user needed it. At this point it made the most sense to make it as a responsive design to incorporate as many uses as possible. It can be as small as a mobile application, as large as a TV or as immersive as a VR headset.

##5.2 Next Steps.
In order for Sessions to continue to grow after May, further development and testing is needed. Although Sessions is being tested with a small group of users who suffer from anxiety, this application as not been clinially tested by professionals, grants have been submitted for the funding of clinical trials. As my own practice shifted with the incoming tide to incorporate psychology, biology and nature, I will be pursuing a secondary Master’s Degree Parsons for Data Visualization to help further Sessions with a deeper knowledge of mapping large data sets. Just as I was challenged to surf, I challenged myself to continue on the path, which has allowed me to replicate my own personal experience of healing for others, paddle new breaks. Sessions has allowed me to grow both as a designer and as a person. I plan to use the personal and professional knowledge that I have gained to further develop my application. This is reflected in my continued dedication and commitment to my project. As the next set of waves are rolling in, I’m paddling and ready to pop-up and ride.
